# Outlook MCP: Strategic Development Roadmap

## Development Philosophy

**Iterative Enhancement Strategy**: Build incrementally on the solid foundation, delivering user value at each phase while maintaining system stability and avoiding feature complexity overload.

## Phase 1: Calendar Foundation Enhancement (Weeks 1-2)
*Goal: Complete core calendar functionality with high-impact, low-complexity features*

### Phase 1A: Essential Properties (Week 1)
**Quick Wins - Immediate User Value**

#### P0 Features (2-3 days)
1. **All-Day Events Toggle**
   - Add `isAllDay` boolean parameter
   - Update `calendar/create.js` and input schema
   - Handle date formatting differences (date vs datetime)

2. **Privacy/Sensitivity Settings**
   - Add `sensitivity` parameter ("normal", "personal", "private", "confidential")
   - Simple enumeration validation
   - Immediate user privacy control

3. **Importance Levels**
   - Add `importance` parameter ("low", "normal", "high")
   - Basic priority indication for users

#### P1 Features (2-3 days)
4. **Availability Status (Show As)**
   - Add `showAs` parameter ("free", "tentative", "busy", "outOfOffice")
   - Calendar conflict awareness

5. **Reminder Configuration**
   - Add `reminderMinutesBeforeStart` parameter
   - Default reminder settings with user override

**Deliverables:**
- Updated `calendar/create.js` with new parameters
- Enhanced input schema validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Updated documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing calendar functionality remains stable
- New parameters work correctly via MCP calls
- Clear error messages for invalid parameters

### Phase 1B: Enhanced User Experience (Week 2)

#### P1 Features (3-4 days)
1. **Categories/Labels Support**
   - Add `categories` array parameter
   - Category validation and management
   - Visual organisation enhancement

2. **Enhanced Location Handling**
   - Upgrade from simple string to location object
   - Support for `displayName`, `locationType`, `address`
   - Foundation for future room booking

#### P2 Features (2-3 days)
3. **Basic Teams Meeting Toggle**
   - Add `isOnlineMeeting` boolean
   - Auto-generate Teams meeting when enabled
   - Requires additional Graph API permissions

**Decision Point:** Evaluate user feedback on Phase 1A before proceeding with Phase 1B advanced features.

## Phase 2: Strategic Service Integration (Weeks 3-5)
*Goal: Add To Do integration for productivity workflows*

### Phase 2A: To Do Foundation (Week 3)
**Rationale**: To Do integration provides high productivity value with manageable complexity

#### Core To Do Operations (5-6 days)
1. **Authentication Scope Expansion**
   - Add `Tasks.Read`, `Tasks.ReadWrite` scopes
   - Update OAuth configuration
   - Backward compatibility testing

2. **Task List Management**
   - List user's task lists
   - Create new task lists
   - Basic task list operations

3. **Task CRUD Operations**
   - Create tasks with subject, body, due date
   - List tasks from specific lists
   - Update task status and properties
   - Delete tasks

**Module Structure:**
```
todo/
├── index.js          # Tool definitions and exports
├── list-tasks.js     # Task listing functionality
├── create-task.js    # Task creation
├── update-task.js    # Task updates and status changes
├── delete-task.js    # Task deletion
└── list-task-lists.js # Task list management
```

### Phase 2B: Cross-Service Integration (Week 4)
**High-Value Productivity Workflows**

1. **Calendar-Task Integration**
   - Convert calendar events to follow-up tasks
   - Create calendar time blocks from task due dates
   - Task deadline → calendar reminder

2. **Email-Task Integration**
   - Convert emails to tasks (leverage existing email functionality)
   - Task creation from flagged emails
   - Email attachment handling in tasks

### Phase 2C: Advanced To Do Features (Week 5)
1. **Subtasks and Checklists**
2. **Task Categories and Importance**
3. **Recurrence for Recurring Tasks**
4. **Rich Task Bodies and Attachments**

**Success Criteria:**
- Seamless task management alongside existing calendar/email
- Cross-service workflows functioning reliably
- Performance impact minimal on existing features

## Phase 3: Advanced Calendar Features (Weeks 6-7)
*Goal: Implement complex calendar features for power users*

### Phase 3A: Recurrence Implementation (Week 6)
**High Complexity, High Value Feature**

1. **Basic Recurrence Patterns**
   - Daily, Weekly, Monthly patterns
   - End date and occurrence count options
   - Pattern validation logic

2. **Advanced Recurrence**
   - Custom patterns (e.g., every 2 weeks on Tuesday/Thursday)
   - Exception handling (skip specific occurrences)
   - Timezone considerations

### Phase 3B: Meeting Management (Week 7)
1. **Enhanced Meeting Creation**
   - Automatic Teams meeting generation
   - Meeting options and settings
   - Attendee management and responses

2. **Room and Resource Booking**
   - Room availability checking
   - Resource reservation
   - Conflict resolution

**Warning**: These features significantly increase complexity. Consider user demand and feedback before implementation.

## Phase 4: Teams Integration Evaluation (Week 8+)
*Goal: Assess Teams integration value vs complexity*

### Decision Framework
**Proceed with Teams integration IF:**
- Strong user demand demonstrated
- Core calendar/to-do features stable and well-adopted
- Development resources available for high-complexity features
- Clear use cases identified beyond basic meeting creation

### Potential Teams Features (If Proceeding)
1. **Basic Chat Operations** (Week 8-9)
2. **Team/Channel Management** (Week 10-11)
3. **Advanced Meeting Features** (Week 12-13)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards
1. **Feature Flag System**: All new features behind configuration flags
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality must remain stable
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all new features
4. **Documentation**: Update README and tool descriptions
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when advanced features fail

### Quality Gates
- **Phase 1 Gate**: Core calendar enhancements work reliably
- **Phase 2 Gate**: To Do integration provides clear user value
- **Phase 3 Gate**: Advanced features don't compromise system stability

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy features incrementally, not as large releases
2. **User Feedback Loops**: Gather feedback after each major feature addition
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure new features don't impact existing performance
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to disable features if issues arise

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- All calendar properties from GUI analysis implemented
- Zero regression in existing functionality
- Positive user feedback on enhanced calendar features

### Phase 2 Success
- To Do integration provides clear productivity workflows
- Cross-service features work reliably
- User adoption of task management features

### Phase 3 Success
- Advanced calendar features used by power users
- System remains stable under complex usage patterns
- Clear differentiation from basic calendar tools

## Resource Allocation

### Estimated Development Time
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks (Calendar foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks (To Do integration)
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks (Advanced calendar)
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 weeks (Teams, if pursued)

### Skill Requirements
- **Phases 1-2**: Moderate Graph API knowledge, good JavaScript skills
- **Phase 3**: Advanced API integration, complex data structures
- **Phase 4**: Expert-level Microsoft ecosystem knowledge

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritises building upon the strong existing foundation with incremental, high-value enhancements. The strategy balances user value delivery with technical complexity management, ensuring the Outlook MCP remains stable, useful, and maintainable throughout its evolution.

**Key Principle**: Each phase should deliver standalone value while preparing the foundation for subsequent phases. If at any point complexity outweighs user benefit, the roadmap allows for strategic pivoting or feature scope reduction.
