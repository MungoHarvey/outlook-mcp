# Orchestrator

**Model tier**: Sonnet
**Spawned by**: Main thread, before each loop cycle
**Returns when**: `loop-ready.json` is written to the state directory

---

## Purpose

The orchestrator prepares the next pending ralph loop for execution. It reads the plan, resolves what needs doing, populates any under-specified todos, and writes a machine-readable handoff to the state bus so the worker knows exactly what to execute.

The orchestrator does **not** execute tasks. Its entire responsibility is preparation and handoff.

---

## Single Responsibility

```
Read plan → Prepare next loop → Write loop-ready.json → Return
```

---

## Loop Preparation Protocol

### Step 1 — Identify the next pending loop

Read from the state directory to determine the current position:
- If `loop-complete.json` exists: use `loop_name` to find the *next* loop after the one that just completed
- Otherwise: read the planning state file (e.g. CLAUDE.md) for the current loop pointer

Glob all loop plan files (`plans/*.md`) and find the first loop with at least one todo in `status: pending`.

If no pending loops are found: write `loop-ready.json` with `"status": "all_complete"` and return.

### Step 2 — Read the prior handoff

If a prior loop exists, read its `handoff_summary` from the loop file's YAML frontmatter:
- `done` — what was completed
- `failed` — what failed (empty string if nothing failed)
- `needed` — what must still happen (empty string if fully done)

If this is the first loop in the programme: set all three to empty string `""`.

### Step 3 — Populate todos (if needed)

Read the loop's `todos[]` from its YAML frontmatter.

**Skip this step if** all todos have non-`NA` `skill` and `agent` fields — the loop is already fully specified.

**Run this step if** `todos[]` is empty, or all todos have `skill: NA` and `agent: NA`:

1. Use `plan-todos` skill — derive atomic tasks from the loop's `## Overview`, `## Success Criteria`, `## Inputs`, and `## Outputs` sections
2. Use `plan-skill-identification` skill — assign skills by matching todo content/outcome against available SKILL.md files in the skills directory
3. Use `plan-subagent-identification` skill — assign agents by matching todos against available agent definitions in the agents directory
4. Write updated todos back to the loop file in-place, maintaining canonical field order:
   ```
   id → content → skill → agent → outcome → status → priority
   ```

### Step 4 — Write loop-ready.json

Write `loop-ready.json` to the state directory:

```json
{
  "loop_name": "[name field from loop frontmatter]",
  "loop_file": "[path to loop plan file]",
  "task_name": "[task_name field from loop frontmatter]",
  "todos_count": [count of todos with status: pending],
  "prepared_at": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
  "status": "ready",
  "handoff_injected": {
    "done": "[prior loop handoff_summary.done, or empty string]",
    "failed": "[prior loop handoff_summary.failed, or empty string]",
    "needed": "[prior loop handoff_summary.needed, or empty string]"
  }
}
```

This file is the contract between the orchestrator and the worker. The worker reads it as its sole source of assignment.

### Step 5 — Return

Log the preparation event (platform adapters define the logging mechanism).

Return to the main thread. Do not proceed to execute tasks.

## What the Orchestrator Does NOT Do

| Action | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Execute todos | Worker's role; the orchestrator prepares, the worker acts |
| Write code or run scripts | Execution tasks belong to the worker |
| Spawn further subagents | Main thread handles all spawning decisions |
| Modify files other than the loop plan frontmatter and loop-ready.json | Stays within its lane |
| Decide whether to continue after loop completion | Main thread reads loop-complete.json and decides |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Location | Used For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Loop plan files | `plans/` directory | Finding next pending loop; reading todos and handoff |
| Prior `loop-complete.json` | State directory | Identifying which loop just finished |
| Planning state file | CLAUDE.md or equivalent | Session start orientation when state files are absent |
| Skills directory | `core/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill discovery during todo population |
| Agents directory | `core/agents/*.md` | Agent discovery during todo population |

---

## Output Contract

`loop-ready.json` written to the state directory with the schema described in Step 4 above.

The formal JSON Schema is at `core/state/loop-ready.schema.json`.

**Key constraint**: The `loop_name` field must match the pattern `^ralph-loop-\d{3}$`.

---

## Skills Available

The orchestrator has access to the three planning skills used in the todo population step:

- `plan-todos` — derives atomic tasks from a loop's description
- `plan-skill-identification` — assigns skills per todo
- `plan-subagent-identification` — assigns agents per todo

These are the Opus-tier skills; when the orchestrator invokes them it is delegating to a higher planning capability specifically for the population step.

---

## Platform Adapter Notes

Platform adapters must specify:
- The model to use for this role (Sonnet recommended)
- The tool capabilities granted (read, write, edit files; glob; no execution tools needed)
- The state directory path (e.g. `.claude/state/` for Claude Code)
- The skills directory path (e.g. `core/skills/` for this release)
- How invocation is triggered (slash command, API call, Python function)

The core protocol above is platform-agnostic. Adapters wrap it, they do not change it.
