# Skill Catalogue Reference

Authoritative catalogue of all core skills in `core/skills/`. Used by `plan-skill-identification`
to match todos against available skills. Each entry includes the trigger conditions, scope, and
assignment guidance.

---

## How to Use This Catalogue

For each todo with `skill: NA`:

1. Read the todo's `content` and `outcome` fields
2. Identify the primary action (file creation, analysis, planning, execution)
3. Match against the **When to assign** conditions below
4. If multiple skills match, choose the **most specific** one
5. If no skill matches, assign `NA` for general tasks, or flag `MISSING: [description]` for tasks that clearly need a specialist skill that does not yet exist

## Core Skills

### `phase-plan-creator`

**Model tier**: Opus
**Purpose**: Creates a phase plan document from a programme description, defining scope, outputs, loop count, and success criteria for an entire phase.

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes creating or populating a `phase-{N}.md` file
- Todo involves defining the scope, outputs, or success criteria for a complete programme phase
- Todo is "design the plan for Phase X" or "break the programme into phases"

**When NOT to assign:**

- Creating individual loop files (use `ralph-loop-planner` instead)
- Decomposing a loop into todos (use `plan-todos` instead)
- Any execution work — this skill is planning-only

**Trigger keywords**: phase plan, phase document, programme scope, phase scope, define phases, create phase-N.md

---

### `ralph-loop-planner`

**Model tier**: Sonnet (orchestrator)
**Purpose**: Decomposes a single phase into bounded ralph loops. Writes the loop YAML stubs (name, task_name, max_iterations, on_max_iterations, handoff_summary skeleton, empty todos[]) into a phase's ralph loops file.

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes creating or populating `phase-{N}-ralph-loops.md`
- Todo involves deciding how many loops a phase needs and naming them
- Todo is "decompose Phase X into loops" or "plan the loops for this phase"

**When NOT to assign:**

- Decomposing a loop into individual todos (use `plan-todos` instead)
- Writing the content of the loop itself — only the stub structure
- Execution of any loop work

**Trigger keywords**: ralph loops, loop stubs, loop decomposition, decompose phase, loop planning, new-loop, ralph-loop-planner

---

### `plan-todos`

**Model tier**: Opus
**Purpose**: Reads a ralph loop's Overview, Success Criteria, Inputs, and Outputs and derives an atomic, verifiable `todos[]` array for the YAML frontmatter. Writes each todo with `skill: NA` and `agent: NA` (to be filled by downstream skills).

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes populating the `todos[]` array in a loop file
- Todo is "decompose loop-{NNN} into todos" or "write the todos for this loop"
- Todo involves translating a loop's success criteria into atomic tasks

**When NOT to assign:**

- Assigning skills to existing todos (use `plan-skill-identification` instead)
- Assigning agents to existing todos (use `plan-subagent-identification` instead)
- Any work that isn't specifically about populating the todos array

**Trigger keywords**: populate todos, decompose into todos, write todos, plan todos, todo array, atomic tasks

---

### `plan-skill-identification`

**Model tier**: Opus
**Purpose**: Reads todos with `skill: NA` and assigns the best-fit skill from the available SKILL.md files. Updates the `skill:` field in-place using the canonical field order. Flags `MISSING:` when no skill covers a task.

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes assigning skills to a loop's todos
- Todo is "identify skills for loop-{NNN}" or "fill skill fields"
- Todo involves matching tasks to available SKILL.md files

**When NOT to assign:**

- Populating todos[] from scratch (use `plan-todos` first)
- Assigning agents (use `plan-subagent-identification` instead)
- Any execution work

**Trigger keywords**: assign skills, skill mapping, identify skills, fill skill fields, skill identification, match skills

---

### `plan-subagent-identification`

**Model tier**: Opus
**Purpose**: Reads todos with skills already assigned and determines which tasks should be delegated to subagents. Updates the `agent:` field in-place. Flags `MISSING:` when a task warrants delegation but no suitable agent exists.

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes assigning agents to a loop's todos
- Todo is "identify agents for loop-{NNN}" or "fill agent fields"
- Todo involves determining which todos should be delegated to workers vs run in orchestrator context

**When NOT to assign:**

- Assigning skills (use `plan-skill-identification` first)
- Populating todos[] from scratch
- Any execution work

**Trigger keywords**: assign agents, agent mapping, subagent identification, fill agent fields, delegation, who does this task

---

### `progress-report`

**Model tier**: Sonnet
**Purpose**: Reads plan files, loop handoff summaries, todo statuses, and git commit history
to produce a structured markdown progress report. Read-only synthesis — never modifies artefacts.

**When to assign:**

- Todo content describes generating a progress summary or status report for a phase or programme
- Todo is "produce a progress report" or "summarise what has been done"
- Todo involves reading handoff summaries and todo statuses to compile an audit trail

**When NOT to assign:**

- Any execution work — this skill is read-only synthesis
- Creating or modifying plan files (use `phase-plan-creator` or `ralph-loop-planner` instead)
- Populating todos (use `plan-todos` instead)

**Trigger keywords**: progress report, status report, what happened, show progress, review progress, audit, summarise completed work, loop summary

## Pipeline Position Summary

```
phase-plan-creator          → Phase plan (phase-{N}.md)
       ↓
ralph-loop-planner          → Loop stubs (phase-{N}-ralph-loops.md)
       ↓
plan-todos                  → Populated todos[] (skill: NA, agent: NA)
       ↓
plan-skill-identification   → skill: fields assigned
       ↓
plan-subagent-identification → agent: fields assigned
       ↓
[execution via adapter]     → Work begins
```

Each skill operates on the output of the previous. Running them out of order produces incomplete or invalid results.

## Assignment Quick Reference

| Task type | Skill to assign |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Create phase plan document | `phase-plan-creator` |
| Create loop stubs for a phase | `ralph-loop-planner` |
| Populate todos[] in a loop | `plan-todos` |
| Assign skill: fields in todos | `plan-skill-identification` |
| Assign agent: fields in todos | `plan-subagent-identification` |
| Generate progress report or status summary | `progress-report` |
| General file I/O, git ops, simple scripting | `NA` |
| Verification scans, grep checks | `NA` |
| Writing handoff_summary or loop-complete.json | `NA` |

---

## `NA` Assignment Rules

Set `skill: NA` when the task is any of the following:

- Plain file creation or editing (no specialist knowledge required)
- Git operations: `git add`, `git commit`, `git tag`
- Running a verification scan (`grep`, `find`, `python -m pytest`)
- Writing structured data that follows a documented schema (loop-ready.json, loop-complete.json)
- Updating `handoff_summary` in a loop file
- Creating a snapshot checkpoint
- Simple bash scripting without domain-specific logic

---

## Missing Skill Flagging

When a todo clearly needs a specialist skill that does not exist in the catalogue:

```yaml
skill: "MISSING: json-schema-validator — validates JSON files against draft-07 schema definitions"
```

The `MISSING:` prefix makes skill gaps immediately visible to the project owner. Do not silently fall back to `NA` when specialist knowledge is genuinely required and no skill covers it.
